# 01 — Foundations: On-Device AI Primer (Q&A)

> Cover the answer, speak aloud, then check follow-ups. Simple language. Named work only — never S-codes in speech.

### Q1. North star? `(45–60s)`
**Answer:**

> “On-device AI is retrieval + guarded inference + an explicit degrade path — not “call an LLM.” Private data stays local; models are optional accelerators behind capability checks. ---.”

**Follow-ups:**

| Follow-up | Answer |
|---|---|
| One-sentence opener? | Lead with the core rule in one sentence. |
| Common trap? | Name the usual mistake and how you avoid it. |

**How can I relate to my case:**
- **Concept-only — no shipped story.** Hook BookMyShow / District / Raw only if the interviewer asks for production proof.

### Q2. Staff-level pipeline (draw every time)? `(45–60s)`
**Answer:**

> “text User query → Device eligibility (OS, Neural Engine, memory, thermal, Low Power) → Retrieve local context (BM25 / vector / rules) → Assemble prompt (budget tokens; minimize PII for any cloud path) → Local generate OR cloud fallback OR deterministic template → Stream tokens to UI (AsyncSequence / partial updates) → Log quality + failure reason (not raw private prompts) ---.”

### Q4. Quantization intuition (say cleanly)? `(45–60s)`
**Answer:**

> “Unquantized multi-billion-parameter weights blow mobile RAM budgets. INT8/INT4 shrink weights so mmap + Neural Engine can run. You trade some quality for fit — and you still need a path when the model file is missing.”.

### Q5. RAG intuition (say cleanly)? `(45–60s)`
**Answer:**

> “The model doesn’t know the user’s ledger. I retrieve relevant local rows or docs, put them in the prompt, and ground answers in that context. Numbers for money come from the database, not from free-form generation.” ---.

### Q9. Complexity / ops scripts? `(45–60s)`
**Answer:**

> “Privacy 90s (memorize spine): local-first → retrieve local → generative optional → analytics coarse → cloud only consent + minimize. SD agenda 10s: privacy → retrieve → infer → fallback → metrics.”
